# Cybersecurity Ransom Virus Training Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts designed for cybersecurity training: `decryption.py` and `ransom_virus.py`. These scripts provide practical applications in basic cryptography, file processing, and network communication.

## decryption.py

This script is designed to decrypt previously encrypted files. It retrieves an encryption key from a server and decrypts files with a specific extension (.battal).

### Usage

1. The server IP and port should be set according to the addresses specified in the script.
2. To run the script, use `python decryption.py` in a Python-enabled environment.

## ransom_virus.py

This script is used to encrypt specific file types (e.g., .jpg, .jfif). The created encrypted files replace the original files, which are then deleted.

### Usage

1. The server IP and port should be set according to the addresses specified in the script.
2. To run the script, use `python ransom_virus.py` in a Python-enabled environment.

## Additional Information

- `decryption.py` decrypts encrypted files, restoring their original content.
- `ransom_virus.py` encrypts selected file types, blocking user access.
- Both scripts engage in data exchange over the network while processing files.
- These scripts are useful tools for understanding and implementing security concepts.
